My research focuses on understanding cognition across the lifespan, with a particular focus on the the relationship between working memory and long-term memory.

#### What is the relationship between working memory consolidation and long-term memory and what factors influence this relationship?
This [project](https://osf.io/4xe9t/) looked at how manipulating working memory consolidation influences subsequent delayed recognition performance. [Read more here.](https://doi.org/10.1037/xlm0000954)

This [review](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13423-022-02084-2) explores how working memory consolidation and long-term consolidation may be related.

This [project](https://osf.io/n4d7f/) explored how cognitive mechanisms supporting working memory consolidation are related to **creativity** and subsequent long-term retention. [Read more here.](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13414-022-02598-w)

This [ongoing project](./research/mindwandering.pdf) is exploring how **mind-wandering** impacts working memory performance, particularly across different experimental contexts. 

The first part of this [ongoing project](./research/stress.pdf) explores how **acute stress** may impact the working memory processing.

#### What factors affect cognition in older adults? 

This [project]((https://doi.org/10.1093/geronb/gbz023)) looked at the neural substrates related to perceived **social support** in older adults and the links to cognitive function.
