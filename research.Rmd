My research focuses on the relationship between working memory and long-term memory, particularly how working memory processing can affect our long-term memory performance.

#### What is the relationship between working memory consolidation and long-term memory?
This [project](https://osf.io/4xe9t/) looked at how manipulating working memory consolidation influences subsequent delayed recognition performance. [Read more here.](https://doi.org/10.1037/xlm0000954)

#### Do similar processes underlie creativity and working memory consolidation?
This [ongoing project](./research/creativity.pdf) is exploring how cognitive mechanisms supporting working memory consolidation are related to creative ability.

#### How does mind-wandering affect working memory performance?
This [ongoing project](./research/mindwandering.pdf) is exploring how mind-wandering impacts working memory performance, particularly across different experimental contexts.
