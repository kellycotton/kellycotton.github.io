Read more here.\nThis review also explores how working memory consolidation and long-term consolidation may be related.\nWhat factors influence the effects of working memory processing on long-term memory?\nThis project explored how cognitive mechanisms supporting working memory consolidation are related to creativity and subsequent long-term retention.
