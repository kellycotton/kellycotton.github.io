I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the [Division of Cognitive and Motor Aging](https://www.einsteinmed.edu/departments/neurology/divisions/cognitivemotoraging/dcma.aspx).

My research interests primarily focus on cognitive function across the lifespan, with a particular interest in the relationship between working memory and long-term memory. I use behavioral methods, neuroimaging, and eye-tracking to answer questions about human cognition. I'm also interested in [science communication](https://kellycotton.github.io/writing.html).

I completed my PhD in Cognitive and Comparative Psychology at the City University of New York, Graduate Center and graduated from the University of Rochester with a B.S./B.A. in Brain & Cognitive Sciences and Linguistics.
